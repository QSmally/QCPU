QCPU CLI is a tool which includes an assembler, linker and emulator for the QCPU 2 specification.

Often the most efficient way to learn something new is to see examples, so this documentation shows
how to use each of QCPU CLI's (language) features. QCPU CLI is created with the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org)
and can be compiled without any other dependencies. For starters, running `--help` shows the
different options you may use:

## Root section and linking

`root.s`:

```{.asm}
@section root
@ialign 2

_:                bkpt                    ; entrypoint

@linkinfo(origin) root, 0x0800
```

```{.txt}
$ qcpu --dlinker root.s
... (binary dump)
$ qcpu --virtualise --step root.s
```

The QCPU assembler requires a `root` section (`--rootsection root`) in one of the input files. The
root section is used as base tree to lazily evaluate input symbols and performs dead tree
elimination of unreferenced sections. For preserving data order, the root section can only be
defined once; the section order must be guaranteed.

Linking order and placement is controlled with the `@linkinfo` builtin. Like the root section, only
one file can specify `@linkinfo` builtins to preserve the linking order of the output binary.
Defining section placements, symbols are created and exposed which can be referenced at link-time to
receive the start address of the defined section (zero if eliminated).

The listing above is the general skeleton of any program analysed with the QCPU assembler. It
defines the entrypoint `root` section starting at `0x0800` (physical memory instruction entrypoint).
For liveness, there must be a label at the start of the section (in this case `_`, to discard it).

## Instructions

Like most assembly languages, instruction lines generally look like the following:

```{.asm}
label:            instr op, op, op              ; comments                col 80
```

There are two supported types of comments, prefixed with `;` and `//`. QCPU assembly doesn't support
multiline comments (like `/* */` in C). This allows the assembler to tokenise any line out of
context.

Instructions are taken from the [instruction reference](/) and operands are separated by commas.
Unlike certain pseudo-instructions, instructions always generate 2 bytes.

```{.asm}
                  mldw x1, sp, 4                ; load word from sp + 4
```

### Pseudo-instructions

Pseudo-instructions are formulated like normal instructions, but are interpreted by the assembler to
produce a special kind of output. There are two kinds of pseudo-instructions: special encoding and
instruction aliases.

### Pseudo-instruction encoding

These encoded pseudo-instructions convert some kind of encoding into their representing binary:

* `u8`, `i8`: a byte (unsigned or signed, respectively)
* `u16`, `i16`: a word (unsigned or signed, respectively)
* `u24`, `i24`: a 24 bit word (unsigned or signed, respectively)
* `u32`, `i32`: a 32 bit word (unsigned or signed, respectively)

```{.asm}
var:              u16 0xEAEA              ; memory location containing a two byte variable
ptr:              u16 .var                ; memory location containing a two byte ptr to variable
```

A couple of pseudo-instructions manage variably-sized encoding of data:

```{.asm}
str:              ascii "Hello world!"
sentinel_str:     ascii "This is a C-like string" 0
```

```{.asm}
                  reserve u8, 16          ; 1 * 16 null bytes
                  reserve u16, 16         ; 2 * 16 null bytes
```

### Pseudo-instruction aliases

A couple of pseudo-instructions are aliases to known instructions:

```{.asm}
                  mov t1, x1              ; alias for 'add t1, x1, 0'
                  cut8 t1                 ; alias for 'andiu t1, 0xFF'
                  ret                     ; alias for 'jmpd rp'
```

However, certain aliases (or, more precisely, instruction encodings) have special behaviours:

```{.asm}
                  sysc 1                  ; alias/special behaviour for 'jmpd 0, 1'
```

## Builtins

Documentation of builtins can be retrieved with `--docs builtin` like `--docs align`.

Builtins are provided by the assembler and are prefixed with `@`.

The following documentation is in alphabetical order, but it makes more sense to start to understand
`@section` and `@linkinfo` before anything else, as those builtins provide the foundation for the
assembly language. The underlying examples omit the root section and linkinfo boilerplate.


### `@align`

### `@alignop`

### `@barrier`

### `@buildinfo`

### `@define`

TODO: define with argument

### `@end`

### `@header`

### `@if`

### `@import`

### `@linkinfo`

### `@region`

### `@section`

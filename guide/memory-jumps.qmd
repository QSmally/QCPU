- relative jump/... (also used for branch)
- absolute jump/call, two step

```{.asm}
jmp <mode> sel, +24                  ; relative jump +24
jmp <mode:long> sel, .address        ; absolute jump to ptr at global .address
jmp <mode:call,long> sel, .address   ; absolute call
```

| mode | description                                   |
|------+-----------------------------------------------|
| `00` | short (relative), jump (mode used for branch) |
| `01` | short (relative), call (maybe not used?)      |
| `10` | long (absolute), jump (get directive)         |
| `11` | long (absolute), call                         |

... needing a dynamic address requires a `mldw` proceeded by a `jmp sid`

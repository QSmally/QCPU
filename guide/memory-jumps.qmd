- relative jump/... (also used for branch)
- absolute jump/call, two step

```{.asm}
jmp <mode> dyn, +24                  ; relative jump +24
jmp <mode:long> dyn, .address        ; absolute jump to ptr at global .address
jmp <mode:call,long> dyn, .address   ; absolute call
```

::: {.note}
`.address`: in global section, missing:

- stack section
- stack frame

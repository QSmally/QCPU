Like most assemblers, each QCPU 2 source line contains some combination of the
following four fields:

```{.asm}
label:          instr operands          ; comments
```

If a line starts with the `@` symbol, it refers to an assembler directive.

## Directives

- `@import <file>`: a section-wise include, or a simple paste (static linking)
- `@org <address>`: marks the text or data section address
- `@define <name> <value>`: a C preprocessor-like define
- `@define <namespace>`: a collection of definitions
    - `@define <name> <value>`: adds `@namespace.name`
    - `@end`
- `@macro <name> <arguments>`: defines reusable text
    - `@end`
- `@region <size>`: marks a region with a fixed size, default filled with zeros
    - `@end`
- `@section <type>`: marks the start of a section, for userland
    - `globals`: shared by threads, max. 256 bytes, fixed size
    - `locals`: thread-local, fixed size
    - `stack`: thread-local, initially max. 256 bytes
    - `text`: readonly

### Compiler extensions

A kernel may inject extensions into the files, and these are identified by
specific macro names.

- `@macro kext-stack-base`: leading bytes of the stack

An example is `kext-stack-base`:

```{.asm}
@macro kext-stack-base
env:        reserve u16 1
args:       reserve u16 1
@end
```

## References

Labels are used to reference either data or text. A public `reference:` can be
accessed by any file which `@import`s it. In contrast, a `.reference:` is a
file-local label which can only be accessed by the addresses in the same file. A
linker error is thrown if a private label was attempted to be accessed from the
outside.

An executable is required to have a public `main:` label.

Regardless of access flags, all labels are addressed with the `.<label>` syntax.

## (Pseudo-)instructions

Pseudo-instructions are formulated like normal instructions, but are interpreted
by the assembler to produce another output.

- `u8`: a byte
- `u16`: a word
- `u24`: a 24-bit word
- `u32`: a 32-bit word

A couple of special pseudo-instructions manage the encoding of data:

- `ascii`: like u8, but with explicit ASCII encoding
- `reserve`: uninitialised amount of data

See the instruction set page for more a reference.

A comma between the first operand (that resides in the instruction) and its
secondary byte (such as an offset) is short for having a newline and `u8 ...`.
Having `imm ra, 0x01` is therefore a composition of `imm ra` and `u8 0x01`.

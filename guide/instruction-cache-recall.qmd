If a cache miss happened in the middle of a multi-byte instruction, the instruction and all
subsequently fetched bytes are immediately marked as invalid. The processor jumps to redo the
instruction depending on the parent byte of a multi-byte instruction and which byte was invalid once
the invalidation has been resolved.

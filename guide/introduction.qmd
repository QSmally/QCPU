QCPU 2 is a singular operand architecture, which means its instructions can be 8 bits in size. Its
address space, however, is 16 bits.

## Register map

- Accumulator: `ra` (0)
- Zero register: `zr` (0)
- General purpose: `rb`, `rc`, `rd`, `re`  (1-4)
- Subroutine args: `rx`, `ry`, `rz` (5-7)

### Special registers

There are a couple of special, non-addressable registers:

- Stack pointer: `sp` (`u16`)
- Stack frame pointer: `sf` (`u16`)

### Index register

Certain memory operations can use registers `rx` and `ry` as the 16 bit index register, as opposed
to either one of the special registers or none. See the memory chapter for more information about
memory accessing and data flow.

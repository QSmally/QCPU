QCPU's assembler will automatically choose the memory mode of the instruction
depending on the expression syntax and whichever is more efficient and possible.
For example, a jump will be done in relative mode unless its out of the range of
`-128 < offset <= 128`.

## Register map

- Accumulator: `ra`
- General purpose: `rb`, `rc`, `rd`, `re`, `rf` (0-4)
- Subroutine args: `rx`, `ry`, `rz` (5-7)

::: {.note}
Note: verify use of zero register

An accumulator clear could be `AST r; SUB r;`
:::

### Index register

Certain memory operations use registers `rx` and `ry` as the 16 bit index
register, with `rz` being the dynamic offset register.

### Selectors

Memory instructions can use a known base address.

0. Index register
1. Executable globals
2. Stack base
3. Stack frame

## Register map

- zero: `zr` (0)
- accumulator: `ir` (intermediate register)
- general purpose: `ra`, `rb`, `rc`, `rd` (1-4)
- subroutine args: `rx`, `ry`, `rz` (5-7)

### Memory

Certain memory operations use registers `rx` and `ry` as the 16 bit index
register, with `rz` being the dynamic offset register.
